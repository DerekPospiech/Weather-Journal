# Weather Journal

Project Overview
------------

The goal of this Udacity project was to begin working with API's, Asyncrounous JavaSCript, Node.JS, and GET/Post Requests.

According to the Udactiy Introduction:
"This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App."


Project Main Challenges
------------

* There should be a JavaScript Object named projectData initiated in the file server.js to act as the app API endpoint.
* The personal API Key for OpenWeatherMap API is saved in a named const variable
* The API Key variable is passed as a parameter to fetch()
* Data is successfully returned from the external API
* There should be a GET route setup on the server side with the first argument as a string naming the route, and the second argument a callback function to return the JS object created at the top of server code

Project Dependencies
---------

Node.JS, with cors and bodyparser packages installed. These are included in the package.json. Also an API key from OpenWeatherMap.org is needed.

Install
--------

With node.js installed and running change directory to the project folder, then simply type in the command shell:
```
npm install
```
This will install all files in the package.json as listed above.
